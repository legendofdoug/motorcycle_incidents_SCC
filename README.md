    "### Mission Objective: \n",
    "This project will pull data from various cities throughout the San Francisco Bay Area and try and find where, when and how motorcycle accidents occur throughout the region. This will hopefully serve as tool and grant insight to best avoid certain intersections and behaviours that cause accidents and fatalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "My initial city of focus will be Santa Clara city where I am based. I will then branch out from there."
